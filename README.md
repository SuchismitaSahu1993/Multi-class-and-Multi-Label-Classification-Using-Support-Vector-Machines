# Project "Multi-class-and-Multi-Label-Classification-Using-Support-Vector-Machines"

Classification of Anuran species using Anuran Calls Dataset by implementing Support Vector Machines. We wish to solve a multi-class and multi-label problem by training a classifier for each label and implement One-vs-all approach.

## Evaluation Metrics:
* Exact match
* Hamming Score/loss methods
